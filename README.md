# MERN JWT Authentication

This repository contains a simple example of how to implement JSON Web Token (JWT) authentication in a MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack application.

JWT authentication is a secure and popular method for handling user authentication in web applications. It provides a way to securely transmit information between the client (front-end) and server (back-end) by encoding the data into a token.

In this project, we'll cover the following key components:
- Setting up the MERN stack
- Implementing user registration and login
- Generating JWT tokens
- Securing routes with JWT authentication
- Handling user sessions and authorization


### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed.
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) database set up.
